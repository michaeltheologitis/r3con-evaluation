"""Tests for `evals.r3con.pipeline.runtime.python_executor`.

This module is vendored from smolagents.local_python_executor (Apache-2.0).
These tests pin the contract we depend on — the sandboxing guarantees that
let us run LLM-emitted Python in-process without a subprocess.

If a test here fails after vendor updates, decide deliberately: either
update the test (the new behavior is fine for us) or hold the line
(the change broke a security property we relied on).

Run with:  uv run python tests/unit/test_python_executor.py
