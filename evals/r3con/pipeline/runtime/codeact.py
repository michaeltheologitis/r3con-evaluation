"""Generic CodeAct agent loop — the reusable multi-turn code-execution core.

A CodeAct agent solves a task by writing Python in ``<code>...</code>`` blocks
that run in a persistent, sandboxed in-process interpreter; the runtime feeds
the captured ``print`` output back as ``<observation>...</observation>`` on the
next turn, and the agent commits by calling ``final_answer(x)`` from inside the
sandbox. This module owns that loop and nothing task-specific:

- Each turn: call the LLM with the running message history, clip any
  hallucinated tail past ``</code>``, extract the code, run it, and feed the
  observation back.
- State (variable bindings) survives across turns — the agent builds a
  candidate list in turn 1 and reads it in turn 2.
- ``final_answer`` is registered as a static tool; calling it raises a
  ``FinalAnswerException`` upstream, which surfaces here on
  ``CodeOutput.is_final_answer`` as the termination signal.
- ``max_turns`` caps the loop; on exhaustion we make one final plain-prose LLM call
  that synthesizes an answer from the work done (falling back to the last non-empty
  observation only if that synthesis is empty), rather than refusing.

Callers supply the rendered ``system_prompt`` + ``user_message``, the variables
to bind in the sandbox (e.g. ``{"parse": ...}``), and the usual knobs. The
stage-4 inference agent (``evals.r3con.pipeline.stages.inference.infer_codeact``) is the
first consumer; the loop itself knows nothing about parses or schemas.

Execution errors (runtime, timeout, unauthorized import, missing ``<code>``
block) do **not** end the loop — they are fed back as observations so the
model can correct itself, the same way a human at a REPL would.
